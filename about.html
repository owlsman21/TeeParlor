                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Welcome to TeeParlor, where vintage horror meets modern style. Born from a lifelong passion for classic monsters, creature features, and the chilling aesthetics of cinematic history, TeeParlor is your one-stop shop for unique, high-quality apparel that celebrates the darker side of pop culture.</p>

                    <p>Our journey began with a simple idea: to create t-shirts that we, as fellow horror aficionados, would genuinely love to wear. We scour the depths of cinematic lore, graphic design, and obscure monster mythology to bring you designs that are both nostalgic and fresh, subtle and strikingly bold.</p>

                    <h3>More Than Just Tees</h3>
                    <p>At TeeParlor, we believe that fashion should be a form of self-expression. Our tees aren't just fabric; they're wearable art that allows you to showcase your individuality and your love for the eerie and the eccentric. We prioritize comfort and durability, ensuring that every shirt feels as good as it looks, and stands the test of time (and countless washes).</p>
                    <p>We're constantly exploring new horrors and inspirations, so our collection is always evolving. Whether you're a fan of the iconic Universal Monsters, a connoisseur of slasher films, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty in the bizarre, you'll find something to haunt your wardrobe.</p>

                    <h3>Join Our Crypt</h3>
                    <p>Thank you for visiting TeeParlor. We're thrilled to share our passion with you. Follow us on social media (links coming soon!) and join our community of monster enthusiasts. Wear your horror proudly, and let your inner creature out!</p>
